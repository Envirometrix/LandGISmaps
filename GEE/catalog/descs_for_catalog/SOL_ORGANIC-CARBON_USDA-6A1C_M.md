## Soil organic carbon content in x 5 g / kg at 6 standard depths (0, 10, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) at 250 m resolution


   Soil organic carbon content in × 5 g / kg (to convert to % divide by 2) at 6 standard depths (0, 10, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) at 250 m resolution. The maps are provided using Byte type to significantly reduce file size. Predicted from a global compilation of soil points. Also available for download: soil organic stock maps in in kg / m  2  ( [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1475453 ](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1475453) ) and bulk density maps in kg / m  3  ( [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1475970 ](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1475970) ).
