  description: "Geomorpho90m - Global high-resolution geomorphometry layers: empirical\
    \ evaluation and accuracy assessment. First order derivative layers.\n==========================================================================================================================================\n\
    \n   Geomorphometry is the science of quantitative analysis of the Earth's surface.\
    \ The primary inputs for such terrain analyses are remotely sensed Digital Elevation\
    \ Models (DEMs), which provide an opportunity to derive a wide range of environmental\
    \ variables to better understand patterns and processes in geography, geology,\
    \ climatology, hydrology or biodiversity science. While DEMs provide the elevation\
    \ itself, a wide array of geomorphometry metrics can be extracted to yield information\
    \ regarding topographical variation and land surface parameters, to improve our\
    \ understanding of the geographical, geomorphological and environmental properties\
    \ of a given study area. By the elevation it is possible to describe the topographical\
    \ complexity, which can shape the macro and micro climate of a given area. The\
    \ topographical variation contributes significantly to the environmental complexity\
    \ of a region, and also defines the biotic and abiotic features at a sub-regional\
    \ level. \n\n  Land surface parameters are quantitative measures of various morphometric\
    \ properties of a surface. The most common parameters, slope or aspect, can be\
    \ used to further derive more complex features or curvature profiles of a terrain\
    \ at any given location. Such measures are pivotal to reflect hydrological parameters\
    \ shaping flow and erosion processes within the landscape, and to delineate catchment\
    \ and stream features. Moreover, mapping and assessing landform variability such\
    \ as concavity and convexity is essential to gaining a better picture of the dynamics\
    \ of land erosion and landscape denudation in mountainous environments."
