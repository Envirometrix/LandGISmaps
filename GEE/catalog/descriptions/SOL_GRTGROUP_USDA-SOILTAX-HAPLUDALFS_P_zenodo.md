Predicted USDA soil great groups at 250 m (probabilities)
==========================================================

   Distribution of the USDA soil great groups based on machine learning predictions from global compilation of soil profiles. To learn more about soil great groups please refer to the [ Illustrated Guide to Soil Taxonomy - NRCS - USDA ](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download/?cid=stelprdb1247203.pdf) . Processing steps are described in detail ** [ here ](https://github.com/Envirometrix/LandGISmaps/tree/master/soil) ** . Antartica is not included.
