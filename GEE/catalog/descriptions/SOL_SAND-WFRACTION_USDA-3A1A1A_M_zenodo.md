Sand content in % (kg / kg) at 6 standard depths (0, 10, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) at 250 m resolution
=====================================================================================================

   Sand content in % (kg / kg) at 6 standard depths (0, 10, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) at 250 m resolution. Based on machine learning predictions from global compilation of soil profiles and samples. Processing steps are described in detail ** [ here ](https://github.com/Envirometrix/LandGISmaps/tree/master/soil) ** . Antartica is not included.
