Global landform and lithology class at 250 m based on the USGS global ecosystem map
====================================================================================

   Tomislav Hengl  

   Layers include: lithology (15) and landform (7) indicator maps (0-100%). Derived from the [ USGS Global Ecosystem Map ](https://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/outgoing/ecosystems/Global/) , i.e. the EcoTapestry map. Water bodies masked out. Antartica is not included.
