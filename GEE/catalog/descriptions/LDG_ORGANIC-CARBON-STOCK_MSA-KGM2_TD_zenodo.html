 Soil organic carbon stock (0–30 cm) in kg/m2 time-series 2001–2015 based on the land cover changes
</h1>
<p>
 <p>
  Estimated SOC loss based on the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (ESACCI-LC) land cover maps 2001–2015. This only shows estimated SOC loss (in kg/m2) as a result of change in land use / land cover (assuming standard change factors based on the literature and IPCC reports). Methodology produced for the purpose of the Land Degradation Neutrality (UNCCD) project. Processing steps are described in detail
