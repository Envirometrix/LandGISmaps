  title: 'NASA-USDA Global Soil Moisture Data'
  start: '2010-01-01T00:00:00'
  description: |
    This dataset is generated by integrating
    satellite-derived Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture
    observations into the modified two-layer Palmer model using a 1-D Ensemble
    Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. The assimilation of the
    SMOS soil moisture observations helped improve the model-based soil
    moisture predictions particularly over poorly instrumented areas
    (e.g., Southern African, Middle East) of the world that lack good quality
    precipitation data.
